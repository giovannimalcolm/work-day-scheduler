# work-day-scheduler

Simple day scheduler app. The user is able to input daily activities/events for normal work hours between 9am and 5pm. The single page app contains a title/header with the current day and a clear schedule button as shown in the image below. Beneath these are the scheduling application itself with time-blocks for each hour, 9am-5pm. Hours in the past are identified with a gray coloring, those in the future with green, and the present in red. 

The application can be found at: https://giovannimalcolm.github.io/work-day-scheduler/
